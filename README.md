=============

The Boiled Plates C++ library is a collection of hopefully helpful or interesting classes and helper functions that may make coding in the lovely but pedantic language of C++ a little more bearable.

The library is comprised entirely header files, preventing building and linking headaches that deter many could-be C++ programmers.

This is a personal project, so although it's not open to pull requests it is open to other feature requests and ideas.

This library uses features from C++11.
